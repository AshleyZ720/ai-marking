## *Sample answer:*

 If customers are able to choose their own toppings and flavours they are more likely to provide feedback on their favourite flavour and topping combinations.

### *Sample answer:*

 Economic forces will influence a customer's willingness and ability to spend.

In a downturn, consumers will forego spending on non-essential goods/services and spend their income on essential items such as food and housing. A booming economy may see consumer optimism, more job security and/or rising incomes allowing them to seek quality options.

## *Sample answer:*

 This business could divide the total market into smaller segments so it can target its service to them more effectively and increase sales.

It could also segment by psychographic characteristics and appeal to aspirational pianists who may want to increase their skills and satisfy their personal interest.

## *Sample answer:*

 This business is highly geared and a financial institution, such as a bank, may not be willing to lend additional finance because they pose a risk, which restricts the business's ability to achieve growth. Banks may increase interest rates, which will increase the business's financial commitments and affect its liquidity and capacity to repay existing debt.

### *Answers could include:*

- Superannuation funds.

## *Sample answer:*

 Discounts for early payments is a strategy that allows businesses to increase their cash flow in the short term. This leads to the business accessing funds faster than if it were to wait for a full payment by the original due date. This strategy will not improve the current ratio because the current assets will decrease by the discount offered. The discount offered will reduce the revenue collected and will reduce the current cash available for working capital.

MARK: 2 

FEEDBACK: 
- **Strength**: The student adequately identifies that performance appraisals enable employers to assess employee performance, which is a valid point that reflects an understanding of the purpose of appraisals.
- **Area for Improvement**:
  - The explanation could be more specific about how performance appraisals benefit employers, such as discussing how they can improve employee motivation, inform training needs, or enhance overall productivity.
  - The terms used in the submission (e.g., "assert an assessment") could be clearer and more concise to improve understanding.
  - The second point about providing a benchmark for hiring lacks a strong connection to the direct benefits of appraisals, and could be elaborated upon. Providing specific examples or outcomes would strengthen the argument.
